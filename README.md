# LJMedia

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/infoman/lj_media.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/infoman/lj_media)

This gem was created primarily to extract video embeds from Livejournal pages.

No documentation or examples are available yet, but I will possibly add them in the future.

## API Stability

I can not guarantee that the API will be stable until version 1.0.0. Anything can be changed
at any moment. Use at your own risk or specify the exact version or commit in your Gemfile.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'lj_media', github: 'infoman/lj_media'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install lj_media

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release` to create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
